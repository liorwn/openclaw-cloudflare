# TOOLS.md - Tool Configuration Notes

## Skills
Document skill-specific configuration here as you add integrations.

## Service Credentials
<!-- Keep notes about which services are configured (not the actual secrets!) -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- - Brave Search: configured via BRAVE_API_KEY -->
<!-- - CDP Browser: configured via CDP_SECRET + WORKER_URL -->

## Local Notes
<!-- Add tool-specific notes like camera names, SSH hosts, voice preferences, etc. -->
